PowerBI Project

I'm excited to showcase my inaugural Power BI project for AtliQ Hardware, a comprehensive dashboard that offers valuable insights from five crucial Business angles: Finance, Sales, Marketing, Supply Chain, and Executive.


🔍 Problem Statement: AtliQ Technologies, a swiftly expanding consumer electronics firm, encountered challenges due to their reliance on Excel files for data analysis, particularly during a significant financial setback in Latin America.

🎯 Goal: The aim was to employ Power BI for data analytics, facilitating the resolution of inquiries from stakeholders regarding financial, sales, marketing, and supply chain matters, utilizing a vast dataset encompassing over 1.8 million records.

📊 Data Structure: The snowflake schema was employed for streamlined data modeling.

🛠 Utilized Tools: The toolset encompassed SQL, Power BI Desktop, Excel, DAX Studio, ChatGPT, and Google.

APPROACH

📝 Initial Preparation - Initiated by outlining the project's boundaries and pinpointing the particular requirements for five distinct dashboards catering to stakeholder demands.

📊 Data Gathering - Utilized SQL queries to extract data, ensuring its accuracy and comprehensiveness.

🔄 Data Import - Streamlined the process of incorporating real-time data into Power BI by establishing a connection to the MYSQL Server.

🛠 Data Adjustment - Employed Power Query's capabilities to modify data, generating calculated columns and merging tables to prepare the dataset for analysis.

🎨 Dashboard Crafting - Employed an iterative design process, adhering to 15 established design principles to ensure the dashboards were both user-friendly and informative.

🧪 User Confirmation Testing (UAT) - Worked closely with stakeholders to validate the functionality and precision of the dashboards, making enhancements based on their feedback.

🔄 Stakeholder Input - Actively integrated suggestions and modifications from end-users to improve the dashboards' usefulness.
